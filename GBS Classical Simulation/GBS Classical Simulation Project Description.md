# Evaluating and Improving Correlation-Based Classical Simulations of Gaussian Boson Sampling in Quantum Photonics

**Status (October 2, 2026):** First selective-correction study completed on 144 synthetic 6-, 8-, and 10-mode instances, including 108 held-out cases. A residual-based selection rule reduced mean full-distribution TVD by 37.2% relative to pairwise maximum-entropy fitting, but was less accurate than uniform third-order fitting in every held-out case. The architecture still enumerates all bit strings; scalable sampling and experimental benchmarking remain open. See [[First Research Draft]] for the full result, measured costs, failures, and publication assessment.

**Active research direction (October 3, 2026):** The grant-facing question is now a direct, independently reproducible test of the published positive-P phase-space sampler on the 8,176-mode Jiuzhang 4.0 L1024 configuration it explicitly left for future work. The question, literature gap, fixed evaluation metrics, matched resource protocol, preliminary evidence boundary, and stop/go gates are in [[Jiuzhang 4 Phase-Space Challenge Research Specification]]. The specification is a research plan; this Jiuzhang-scale reproduction has not yet been run.

**Skeptical audit update:** Independent Torontonian calculations confirmed the reference probabilities, but a stronger omitted exact baseline strictly outperformed the selected approximation on error, preprocessing time, and traced memory in 102 of 108 cases. The current enumerated implementation is therefore a **no-go as a computational improvement** on this grid. The 37.2% error reduction remains an information-allocation finding, not evidence of a cheaper practical simulator. [[Skeptical Audit and Stronger Benchmarks]] supersedes the first draft's performance interpretation and records stronger controls, repeated random trials, and matched timing measurements.

**Research area:** quantum information science, quantum photonics, classical simulation, and statistical validation of sampling experiments.

**One-sentence objective:** Determine which information about a Gaussian boson sampling output distribution is worth computing under a limited classical budget, and use that answer to improve the accuracy–cost tradeoff of classical simulation.

This is the full project description. [[Correlation-Based Classical Simulation of GBS]] contains the shorter research plan and initial evidence. [[First Research Draft]] records the completed first selective study. [[Quantum Research]] is the vault index.

## Grant-facing summary

Classical simulation is central to assessing the computational claims of Gaussian boson sampling experiments, but accuracy becomes difficult to verify as the output space grows. Existing approximate methods use tractable summaries of a photonic system, including low-order detector correlations or compressed state representations. This project asks how the information chosen for simulation affects the accuracy–cost tradeoff. A first held-out study found that selecting one quarter of triple dependencies retained 74.1% of the aggregate TVD improvement obtained by adding all triples, with lower measured preprocessing time and traced allocation. This result is bounded to exact small-system fitting, which still requires enumeration of the output space. The next stage will test whether selection can improve a practical sampler under matched accuracy and resource limits. Scaling to experimental benchmarks remains evidence-dependent.

## 1. The system and the computational task

**Technical description.** Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) prepares squeezed optical input states, mixes them through a linear interferometer, and measures the outputs. In the threshold-detector setting considered here, each output mode produces a binary result: click or no click. For $M$ measured modes, one shot is a string $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_M)\in\{0,1\}^M$. A characterized Gaussian optical model defines a target probability distribution $P(x)$ over these strings. Its covariance matrix has a compact description, but calculating or sampling from the complete click distribution can be computationally demanding at experimental scale. Exact threshold-click probabilities can be calculated at small scale using Gaussian-state vacuum probabilities or the Torontonian formalism [1].

**In plain language.** The photonic device repeatedly produces a long string of yes/no detector readings. The research question is whether a conventional computer can generate strings with sufficiently similar probabilities, and how much time and memory that requires. This project concerns the *software calculation* of those strings, not building or modifying optical hardware.

**Important distinction.** The ideal lossless optical model, a calibrated model that includes known experimental imperfections, and the observed hardware samples are three different objects. A simulator may aim to approximate the calibrated model, to reproduce a chosen set of hardware statistics, or both. Those goals must be stated separately in every comparison.

## 2. Why approximations are needed

**Technical description.** A full distribution over $M$ binary outputs has $2^M$ possible patterns. Some classical methods avoid manipulating all of them by matching lower-order marginals or connected correlations, also called *cumulants*. Examples are the click probability of detector $i$, the probability that detectors $i$ and $j$ click together, and analogous quantities for small groups. Villalonga and colleagues constructed efficient samplers from low-order information [2]. Dodd and colleagues precompute cumulants through an order $K$ and use them in a sequential sampling procedure; their cost depends strongly on $K$, and they describe the choice of $K$ as heuristic [3]. Other methods, such as matrix product states, compress different aspects of the quantum state and have their own accuracy–cost parameters [4]. Recent phase-space-based sampling provides another competing approach that a later algorithmic claim would need to benchmark [6].

**In plain language.** Instead of reproducing a huge table of every possible detector pattern, a fast program learns or calculates a smaller set of clues about the patterns. This can be extremely useful. The risk is that the chosen clues may not contain all the information needed for the particular claim being made.

**What is already known.** The cited authors discuss truncation and its limitations. The mere statement that “low-order correlations do not determine the entire distribution” is therefore background, not this project's discovery. Jiuzhang 4.0 also tested and rejected one simple low-order greedy sampler using higher-order statistics [5]. Any new method must address that stronger comparison.

## 3. The specific gap this project will investigate

**Technical description.** Existing approximation methods create an unresolved *allocation problem*: which correlations, conditional dependencies, or state features should be calculated when computing all of them is too expensive? A uniform cutoff includes every term through order $K$ and excludes every term above it. Yet terms of the same order need not contribute equally to the accuracy of a particular sampler or observable. The project will test whether a small, selected set of additional dependencies improves the full sampling distribution more per unit of computational cost than simply raising a uniform cutoff.

Let $Q_{\mathcal S}(x)$ denote a classical sampler using a selected set $\mathcal S$ of corrections. On small systems where $P$ is known, the primary error measure can be total variation distance (TVD):

$$D_{\mathrm{TV}}(P,Q_{\mathcal S})=\frac12\sum_x\left|P(x)-Q_{\mathcal S}(x)\right|.$$

For a candidate correction $S$, a direct small-system measurement of its marginal value is

$$\Delta_S=D_{\mathrm{TV}}(P,Q_{\mathcal S})-D_{\mathrm{TV}}(P,Q_{\mathcal S\cup\{S\}}).$$

The improvement $\Delta_S$ must be weighed against the extra preprocessing time, memory, and per-sample runtime. A practical method should improve the **accuracy–cost frontier**, not just accuracy with unlimited additional computation. Candidate corrections may interact, so testing them one at a time is a starting diagnostic rather than a guarantee that individually ranked terms form the best combination.

**In plain language.** If a computer can afford only a limited number of extra calculations, which ones help most? We will compare the improvement from each candidate with its price. Some calculations may look impressive but give little benefit; others may correct a pattern that the fast simulator repeatedly gets wrong.

**Why ordinary partial derivatives are not the whole answer.** Differentiating accuracy with respect to physical settings such as squeezing or photon loss answers a different question: how sensitive is the *experiment or model* to those settings? Differentiating with respect to continuous weights inside a simulator can help tune those weights. But adding a new three- or four-detector dependency is a discrete design choice. Controlled add/remove tests and cost-matched comparisons are the clearest initial tools. Physical-parameter sensitivity can later help identify regimes where the simulator is fragile, but it should not be confused with selecting simulator features.

## 4. Proposed method: budgeted correlation selection

**Technical description.** The working algorithmic hypothesis is a *selective correction* to a valid, normalized baseline sampler. One possible implementation is:

1. Fix a characterized GBS instance, including its interferometer, squeezing parameters, transmission/loss model, detector type, and whether results are conditioned on total click number.
2. Build a baseline classical sampler using a tractable approximation, initially an independent or pairwise model. Compare later with a faithfully implemented published method if its code and computational needs permit.
3. Generate a limited list of candidate higher-order detector groups. Potential shortlist rules include optical connectivity, strong pairwise dependence, or low-dimensional marginal discrepancies. The shortlist must be cheap enough that searching it does not erase the proposed speed benefit.
4. Calculate exact *small-subsystem* statistics for shortlisted groups from the Gaussian covariance description where feasible. Use these to estimate which corrections are likely to matter. Do **not** use the held-out full distribution to choose corrections on evaluation instances.
5. Add the selected information through a sampling rule that remains a normalized, nonnegative probability distribution. The first study implemented an exponential-family factor model with an enumerated partition function and independent table sampling. A practical larger-system architecture still needs to be chosen and tested; a normalized sequential conditional sampler or a factor model with validated approximate fitting/sampling remains a possibility.
6. Stop when the computational budget is reached. Compare against the uncorrected baseline and a uniform increase in correlation order using matched resource limits.

An example ranking statistic is predicted reduction in validation error divided by added runtime or memory. The *prediction rule* should be developed on training instances and then frozen before held-out evaluation. On small held-out instances, the exact full distribution is used only to measure the final outcome. At larger scales, where full TVD cannot be computed, evaluation must use multiple independently chosen diagnostics rather than treating any one score as proof of full-distribution accuracy.

**In plain language.** We start with a fast simulator. We identify a small number of detector relationships it is likely missing, add only those relationships, and check whether the improved simulator justifies the extra work. To make the test honest, we choose the rule for finding those relationships *before* looking at the exact answers for our final test cases.

**Major technical risks.** Selecting useful local correlations may not fix global errors. A corrected probability model may be expensive to sample from even when its list of factors is short. A rule trained on small optical networks may not transfer to larger or brighter ones. These are substantive research questions, not implementation details to assume away.

## 5. Prototype already completed: what was calculated

**Technical description.** The current prototype is an information diagnostic, **not** the proposed selective sampler and **not** a reproduction of Dodd et al. It generated nine exact, eight-output-mode GBS click distributions: three random interferometers for each of three input settings. The settings were four squeezed inputs with $r=0.8$ and transmission $\eta=0.9$; eight squeezed inputs with $r=0.7$ and $\eta=0.7$; and eight squeezed inputs with $r=0.8$ and $\eta=0.9$. Interferometers were drawn by orthonormalizing complex Gaussian matrices with a fixed random seed. Loss was modeled as uniform linear transmission. These choices explore a few small physical instances; they are not calibrated models of Jiuzhang hardware.

For each instance, the code constructed the output Gaussian covariance matrix. It computed the probability that each subset of modes was vacuum, then used inclusion–exclusion to obtain the probability of every one of the $2^8=256$ threshold-click patterns. The probabilities were checked for normalization and nonnegativity within numerical tolerance. This exact distribution served as a small-system reference.

The prototype then fitted a *maximum-entropy* classical distribution

$$Q_K(x)=\frac{1}{Z_K}\exp\!\left(\sum_{\substack{S\subseteq[M]\\1\leq |S|\leq K}}\theta_S\prod_{i\in S}(2x_i-1)\right),$$

where $Z_K$ normalizes the distribution. Its parameters $\theta_S$ were optimized so that the surrogate matched **every** click moment through order $K$ to numerical precision. Because there are only eight modes, the partition function and TVD could both be evaluated by summing all 256 patterns. This construction isolates the question of whether low-order information is sufficient; it does not reproduce the chain-rule architecture or measured performance of any cited paper.

| Highest matched order $K$ | Number of matched features | Mean full-distribution TVD across nine instances | Range across nine instances |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 8 | 0.278 | 0.215–0.409 |
| 2 | 36 | 0.142 | 0.098–0.183 |
| 3 | 92 | 0.085 | 0.048–0.119 |
| 4 | 162 | 0.048 | 0.026–0.071 |
| 5 | 218 | 0.026 | 0.013–0.039 |

All 45 fits reported convergence, and the largest discrepancy in a matched moment was below $10^{-7}$. The numerical results show a consistent improvement with order in this small sample, while also showing that very accurate low-order moments do not force a zero full-distribution error. They **do not** establish that a selective correction beats a uniform order cutoff, that a published sampler has these TVD values, or that any experimental advantage claim fails.

The reproducible files are [prototype code](work/gbs_low_order_information_probe.py), [exact-distribution helper](work/gbs_projection_probe.py), and [recorded results](outputs/gbs_low_order_information_probe.json). The Python code requires NumPy and SciPy. The helper also contains a separate phase-space experiment that was not used to produce the table above.

**In plain language.** We made nine small examples for which the computer can know every detector pattern's correct probability. We forced a simplified simulator to match all the one-detector, then two-detector, then higher-group statistics. Its answers improved, but matching those statistics was not the same as matching every pattern. This is evidence that the question is measurable, not evidence that our proposed fix works.

## 6. A separate scaling check

**Technical description.** If an algorithm explicitly stores every correlation through order $K$, it needs at least $\sum_{j=1}^{K}\binom{M}{j}$ entries. A four-byte array through order five needs about 2 GB for 144 modes and about 1.22 exabytes for 8,176 modes, before auxiliary indices or working memory. The 144-mode estimate agrees in scale with the cumulant array reported by Dodd et al. [3]. The calculation is preserved in [scaling code](work/gbs_cumulant_scaling_probe.py) and [recorded counts](outputs/gbs_cumulant_scaling_probe.json).

**In plain language.** A method that calculates *every* group of up to five detectors works with a manageable list at 144 outputs. That list explodes when the device has thousands of outputs. This motivates asking whether a carefully chosen small subset can retain the useful information.

**Boundary.** This is a storage estimate for one explicit dense representation. It is not a lower bound on all classical GBS simulation. Compression, sparse or on-demand calculations, other algorithms, and changed target accuracy can alter the cost. It also does not show that selected fifth-order terms will be sufficient.

## 7. How the proposed study will be evaluated

**Technical description.** The first experimental phase is computational and should use predeclared families of exact small GBS instances. Vary mode count, source count, squeezing, transmission, and possibly circuit structure one factor at a time where feasible. Use separate instances to develop the selection rule and to evaluate it. For every held-out case, compare the proposed method against at least (a) its uncorrected baseline and (b) a uniform higher-order method at comparable cost. Publish unsuccessful and inconclusive cases as well as successes.

The primary small-system endpoint is full TVD to the exact characterized distribution. Secondary endpoints are click-count distribution error; marginal and connected-correlation errors by order; performance within fixed-click sectors; preprocessing time; peak memory; and per-sample generation time. If actual experimental data become available, compare samplers and hardware on the *same* declared statistical tests, sample sizes, conditioning rules, and optical calibration. A favorable low-order score alone is insufficient for a claim of full sampling accuracy.

The main success criterion is a **Pareto improvement**: across held-out physical GBS instances, the new method obtains lower distribution error than a named baseline for equal or lower measured cost, or the same error at lower cost. A larger-scale quantum-advantage challenge would require an implemented sampler that remains competitive on the relevant experiment's task and validation tests. A negative outcome is also interpretable: the selected corrections may fail, fail to transfer, or cost as much as a uniform cutoff.

**In plain language.** We will judge the method on examples it was not tuned to, using both accuracy and computer resources. The project succeeds scientifically if it gives a clear, reproducible answer about when targeted corrections help—even if that answer is “they do not help in this regime.”

## 8. Research significance and possible scale

**Technical description.** The near-term output is a controlled map of when accessible GBS validation statistics predict full-distribution accuracy and when they do not. An algorithmic output would be a cost-aware selection and correction strategy that improves classical photonic sampling. Because the underlying problem is how to allocate computation among observable dependencies, the method could eventually inform other structured quantum-sampling simulations, but transfer beyond GBS would require separate tests. A direct BlueQubit Track 2 claim would require a competitive classical algorithm against a concrete experimental benchmark; the present prototype is a feasibility probe for that route.

**In plain language.** This can begin as a manageable science-fair study and grow into an algorithm paper if the correction truly works. Its broad potential comes from making simulation more selective: spend computer time where it changes the answer most. The size of any eventual claim will be determined by the evidence, not set in advance.

## 9. Next decisions and near-term work

The first draft has completed the initial bounded version of these steps. Jiuzhang 2.0 is the eventual threshold-detector target; the first published comparison is the stationary model from Villalonga et al.'s printed TAP equations, enumerated at small scale rather than reproducing their Gibbs runtime. Pair-ranked and residual-ranked triple selection were compared with random selection at the same feature/query budgets, uniform third-order fitting, and uncorrected models. The locked grid contains 36 development and 108 held-out instances; measured runtime, isolated traced memory, and all unfavorable cases are retained in [[First Research Draft]].

The selective method reduced mean TVD from 0.10575 to 0.06641. Uniform third-order fitting reached 0.05269. Selection therefore establishes an intermediate accuracy–cost tradeoff, not a strict improvement over both baseline endpoints or a better large-system published sampler. The initial implementation cannot scale because it enumerates $2^M$ outcomes.

The next work is:

1. Complete the novelty/code audit and reproduce a strong published sampler, with calibrated experimental data identified separately from synthetic cases.
2. Replace enumeration with a practical normalized fitting and sampling architecture, checking sampling reliability and including selection overhead.
3. Freeze a second suite spanning new circuit structures and noise models, with multiple feature budgets and independent training/evaluation.
4. Compare at declared accuracy thresholds and matched measured time/memory, retaining failures and unsupported cases.
5. Extend to experimental subsystems and published validation tests only after the practical sampler passes; revise the paper claim to match the evidence.

The first decision may change the final title, algorithm, or target system. The stable objective is to improve the accuracy–cost tradeoff of classical simulation through measured, selective use of information.
